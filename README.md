About the project:
The project's ultimate goal is to display, using the Java programming 
language, a Relational Graph where the vertices are references to a 
Personage, the edges are the link it has with other personages. Since the 
vertices are references to a personage, which is an object on it's own, 
the user should also be able to select a vertice v and see it's adjacent 
vertices in a subgraph or select v to see the personage's full details.

Currently, the graph structure and its graphical implementation are working, with the subgraph implementation under development.


Why this project exists?
This project was conceived out of an idea I had to help me understand graphs, 
specifically its theory. Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search 
(DFS) are one of the methods I'd like to implement to help me learn.
