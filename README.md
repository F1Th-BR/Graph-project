About the project:
The ultimate project goal is to display, using the Java programming language, a Relational Graph
where the vertices are references to a Personage, the edges are the link it has with other
personages. Since the vertices are references to a personage, which is an object on it's own, 
the user should also be able to select a vertice v and see it's adjacent vertices in a subgraph 
or select v to see the personage's full details.

Currently, the graph structure is working, with it's graphical implementation under development.


Why this project exists?
This project was conceived out of an idea I had to help me understand graphs, specifically it's 
theory. Breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-first Search (DFS) are one of the methods I'd like 
to implement to help me learn.
